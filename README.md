# Realtek r8125 DKMS for centos 8

Since the kernel version 4.18.x distributed with CentOS 8 seems make a modification to make their kernel source tree compatible with mainline 5.6.x+, I made some changes in realtek-r8125 to allow it work under centos 8 kernel.
This provides Realtek r8125 driver in DKMS way so that you can keep the latest driver even after the kernel upgrade.

## Installation

There are 3 ways to install this DKMS module. Choose 1 as your tastes.

Those are not interfering with each other. So you can do all 3 methods but don't need to.

Installation using the Debian package is recommended for the sake of getting the newer driver.

### Debian package

#### Released package file

Download the latest Debian package from the Release tab on the Github repository.

Then enter the following command.

```bash
sudo dpkg -i realtek-r8125-dkms_9.005.01-1_amd64.deb
```

If dependency error occurs, try to fix that with `apt` command.

```bash
sudo apt install --fix-broken
```

#### Launchpad PPA (Recommended)

Add the Launchpad PPA.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:hardkernel/ppa
```

Then install the package using `apt` tool.

```bash
sudo apt install realtek-r8125-dkms
```

### autorun.sh

Using the `autorun.sh` script that Realtek provides on their original driver package. This is **not installed as a DKMS**, only efforts to the current kernel.

Download or clone this repository and move to the extracted directory, then run the script.

```bash
sudo ./autorun.sh
```

### dkms-install.sh

This script is from aircrack-ng team. You can install the DKMS module by a simple command.

Download or clone this repository and move to the extracted directory, then run the script.

```bash
sudo ./dkms-install.sh
```

## Debian package build

You can build yourself this after installing some dependencies including `dkms`.

```
